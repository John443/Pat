/*
This time, you are supposed to find A+B where A and B are two polynomials.

Input

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, and each line 
contains the information of a polynomial: K N1 aN1 N2 aN2 ... NK aNK, where K is the number 
of nonzero terms in the polynomial, Ni and aNi (i=1, 2, ..., K) are the exponents and coefficients, 
respectively. It is given that 1 <= K <= 10ï¼Œ0 <= NK < ... < N2 < N1 <=1000.

Output

For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, 
with the same format as the input. Notice that there must be NO extra space 
at the end of each line. Please be accurate to 1 decimal place.
